Main240305 file is the main program, please open this file for simulation
The following is a brief explanation of the functions of each part of the code. The specific IO has complete comments in the program. If there is anything that is not detailed, you can consult me.

The following is a description of the inspection of each part:
1. Demonstration of magnetization vector calculation using RM, GAM methods. The initial direction of the magnetization vector is towards B0.
2. Calculation of the RM, GAM methods when the pulse time is tdd. The initial magnetization vector direction is random, the alpha range can be changed, and B0 changes with the change of the alpha range.
